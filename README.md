# In-wall coolers and vents (RimWorld mod)

Mod allows to place coolers and vents inside the walls.
If you hate when raiders easily breaks your rooms (especially fridges) this mod is for you =)

**[Installation]** Compatible with existing saves. Just place additional walls in coolers and vents positions to stop the air get through.

**[Uninstallation]** All coolers and vents placed on the walls will be disassembled into components.
